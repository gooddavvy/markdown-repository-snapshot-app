# markdown-repository-snapshot-app backend

## Description & Details

Description: Snapshot a repository & save non-excluded results of snapshot in a generated markdown file

Current Phase: Completed (sort of)

**Need to work on:**

- [x] Making it work via GitHub API and GitHub API token
- [x] Doing it via getting and unzipping zip file for repository

**What is this?**

This is the backend part. **Feel free to look at the code--the app is all open-source!**
