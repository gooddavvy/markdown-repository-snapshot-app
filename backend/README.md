# Go_markdown-repository-snapshot backend

Description: Snapshot a repository & save non-excluded results of snapshot in a generated markdown file

Current Phase: BETA

**Need to work on:**

- [x] Making it work via GitHub API and GitHub API token
- [ ] Doing it via web scraping

# What is this?

This is the backend part. **Feel free to look at the code--the app is all open-source!**
